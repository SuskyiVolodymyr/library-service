# üèõÔ∏èüìñ Library Service Project üìñüèõÔ∏è

## Project Description

The Library Service Project is designed to modernize the library system in your city. The current system for tracking books, borrowings, users, and payments is outdated, with all processes being handled manually and recorded on paper. The system lacks the ability to check the inventory of specific books, requires cash payments, and does not effectively track the return of books. This project implements an online management system for book borrowings to optimize the work of library administrators and make the service more user-friendly.



## How to Run the Project with Docker

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd library-service
```
2. **Build the Docker image and containers:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
3. **Copy the sample environment file and populate it with the required data**

4. **Create a superuser:**
```bash
docker compose exec -it library python manage.py createsuperuser
```
5. **Access the application:**
* Admin interface: Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and log in with the superuser credentials.
* API endpoints: Access the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/.
6. **Shut down the Docker containers:**
```bash
docker-compose down
```
### Running Tests
* To run tests, execute:
```bash
docker-compose exec web python manage.py test
```

## How to Run the Project with Virtual Environment
1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd library-service
```
2. **Set up the virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. **Install the dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. **Run migrations:**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
5. **Copy the sample environment file and populate it with the required data**
6. **Create a superuser:**
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
7. **Run Redis Server:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```
8. **Run celery worker for tasks handling:**
```bash
celery -A library_service worker -l INFO -P solo
```
9. **Run celery beat for tasks handling:**
```bash
celery -A library_service beat -l INFO --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```
10. **Run the development server:**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
11. **Access the admin interface:**
* Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and log in with the superuser credentials.


### Running Tests
